{"name":"Population-comparator","tagline":"","body":"# population-comparator\r\n\r\n**population-comparator** is a bare-bones web application that allows the user to compare age population data between two countries. The web page is dynamically generated on the server-side using Node.js, based on data retrieved from the [World Population Project](http://www.population.io/) via its restful API.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to practice using (1) Node.js to generate dynamic web pages, and (2) Heroku to deploy Node.js apps. As such, the app is visually scarce, since data visualization and CSS is out-of-scope for this project.\r\n\r\nYou can try the app [here](https://sleepy-citadel-38083.herokuapp.com/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
